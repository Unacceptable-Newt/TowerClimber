Instruction:
As everyone in our group is working with other 3 courses in the same time, it is reasonable to estimate the time in person-day, rather than in Story Point. But we will still add story point. And in our defination, 1 story point takes 48 mins, and 1 person-day takes max to 8 hours a day. 

The following are abbreviations:
PD = person-day(s)
